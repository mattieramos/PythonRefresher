# an object is an instance of a class, a class simply defines the blueprint or the template for creating objects, and
# objects are the actual instances based on that blueprint. So we can have tens of hundreds of points on the screen,
# these are the objects or the instances.
# So to create an object, we type out the name of our class and then call it like a function

point1 = Point()
point1.x = 10
point1.y = 20
print(point1.x)
point1.draw()

point2 = Point()
point2.x = 1
print(point2.x)

# we use classes to define new types, these types can have methods that we define in the body of the class, and
# they can also have attributes that we can set anywhere in our programs.
